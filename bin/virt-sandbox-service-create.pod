virt-sandbox-service create - Create a Security container

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  virt-sandbox-service [-c URI] create [-h] -u UNIT_FILE [ --clone ] [-p PATH] [-t TYPE] [-l LEVEL | -d] [-i SIZE] [-n] NAME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

virt-sandbox-service is used to manage secure sandboxed system services.
These applications will be launched via libvirt and run within a virtualization
technology such as LinuX Containers (LXC), or optionally QEMU/KVM. The
container / virtual machines will be secured by SELinux and resource
separated using cgroups.

The create command will setup a sandbox for running one or more systemd unit files

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Display help message

=item B<-c> URI, B<--connect URI>

The connection URI for the hypervisor (only LXC or QEMU are
supported currently).

=item B<-u UNIT_FILE>, B<--unitfile UNIT_FILE>

Name of the systemd unit file to be to run within the container. Can be repeated
if multiple unit files are required within the sandbox.

=item B<-C>, B<--clone>

Clone content from /etc and /var directories that will be mounted within the container.

=item B<-p PATH>, B<--path PATH>

Select path to store container content.

Default: C</var/lib/libvirt/filesystems>.

=item B<-l LEVEL>, B<--level LEVEL>

MCS Level with which to run the container.

=item B<-t TYPE>, B<--type TYPE>

SELinux type with which to run the container.

Default: svirt_lxc_net_t

=item B<-l LEVEL>, B<--level LEVEL>

MCS Level with which to run the container.

=item B<-d>, B<--dynamic>

Use dynamic MCS labeling for the container

=item B<-i SIZE>, B<--image SIZE>

Create file system image file of this size to store container content.

=item B<-u unitfile>, B<--unitfile unitfile>

systemd Unit file to run within the container

=head1 EXAMPLE

Create httpd1 container

 # virt-sandbox-service create -C -u httpd.service httpd1
 Created container dir /var/lib/libvirt/filesystems/httpd1
 Created sandbox config /etc/libvirt-sandbox/httpd1.sandbox
 Created unit file /etc/systemd/system/httpd@httpd1.service

content in these directories outside of the container and
processes within the container will see the content.
