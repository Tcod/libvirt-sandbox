=head1 SYNOPSIS

Clone a Security container

  virt-sandbox-service [-c URI] clone [-h] [-l LEVEL] -s SOURCE DEST

=head1 DESCRIPTION

virt-sandbox-service is used to manage secure sandboxed system services.
These applications will be launched via libvirt and run within a virtualization
technology such as LinuX Containers (LXC), or optionally QEMU/KVM. The
container / virtual machines will be secured by SELinux and resource
separated using cgroups.

The clone command will clone the SOURCE security sandbox container into the DEST security sandbox container.
