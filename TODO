         libvirt-sandbox TODO list
         =================

systemd-tmpfiles --create needs to be run within the container, before any 
apps are started, since it will populate /run

CGROUPFS: integration so libvirt does it rather then systemd within the container
	 We need kernel labeling support for cgroupfs so we can allow systemd to write to its section of the cgroupfs.

SYSLOG:  Currently syslog messages are going no where within the container.  
If we run a syslog within the container will it get messages from the outside?  Should we just use systemd-journal.  I think sysadmins will want to be able to look in /var/log/messages within the container.

EXECUTE:
	virt-sandbox-service execute --command "BLAH" does not work.  We need to have the ability to execute any random command within the container, and get stdin, stdout, stderror outside the container.

HOSTNAME:
	Currently if I execute hostname within the conatiner it sees the name of the host not the name based on the container name or the IP Address associated with dhclient.

virt-sandbox-service connect NAME hangs when you attempt to end the connection.
^d should bring you back to the host terminal.

Need a mechanism to allow admins to specify additional services to run within 
the container.  For example you may want to run mysql and apache within the same container.
